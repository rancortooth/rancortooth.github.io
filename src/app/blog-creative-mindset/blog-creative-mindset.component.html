    <h1>Getting into a Creative Mindset</h1>
    <p>Being creative on-demand is difficult. Whether it’s for your favorite hobby (such as drawing webtoons, in my case) or for work, it’s difficult to switch into a mode where one can suddenly be creative and get the ideas flowing. I’m not a psychologist, therapist, or any sort of mind expert, but I’d like to write about my creative process in case it can help anybody out there with their creative endeavors. I’ll reference drawing cartoons in this blog, but I’d imagine the process can be applied to almost any creative project.</p>
    <h2>Coming up with New Ideas</h2>
    <p>This must be the most difficult part of being creative, coming up with brand new ideas for your projects from scratch. If you want to start drawing a brand-new comic with a brand-new storyline, plopping down in front of a blank canvas will get you no where fast. Don’t conflate the pressure to get started and make progress with the invention of the new ideas. To generate the new ideas, I find it best to entirely remove myself from the same place I do my work. Put yourself into a distraction-free, pleasant (but not exciting) environment where you can let your mind wander. In my case, I like taking a walk in a familiar place. Where you go or what you do doesn’t matter, so long as it mostly meets these criteria:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Distraction free (This also means that you’re not expecting to be disturbed any second by a call, text, appointment, etc. You may need to put aside time specifically for this purpose.)</li>
        <li>Pleasant, but not exciting (i.e., walking can be pleasant, but if it’s raining out or too hot then you’ll be focusing on the bad weather rather than your thoughts)</li>
        <li>Familiar (Unless your intention is to gain new inspiration, a familiar place will be less distracting. I.e., I chose a route I’ve walked 100 times before because I won’t be wondering what’s around the next corner)</li>
        <li>Sensory deprivation (I find it helpful, while walking, to wear sound-blocking headphones, play calm music, and even don sunglasses, all for the purpose of blocking the outside world)</li>
        <li>Write it down (Bring some means of recording information with you, e.g., a little notebook, a recording app on your phone, whatever. You’ll want to jot the idea down as soon as possible so you can free your mind to move onto the next thing and not feel stressed about having to remember everything you just came up with)</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <p>Remember, the place you go or what you do isn’t important. If you find comfort in sitting on a wall at a nearby park, sitting at the beach and hearing the waves, or jogging on a treadmill in a basement, these are all great ways of getting into a creative mindset.</p>
    <p>Once you are in your distraction-free environment, let your mind wander while keeping loosely focused on the central idea you’re pondering. Your mind will constantly wander to a million other things, but just bring it gently back when you notice yourself getting too distracted. No pressure here – nobody can come up with great ideas with a gun to their head. If you don’t think of that great idea you wanted, then you can always try again. You may even find that while you didn’t think of that great idea during your creative session, it’s still simmering in the back of your mind. Then suddenly, in the middle of doing the dishes, something dawns on you! Don’t pressure yourself to come up with an idea to the point of resenting the creative endeavor. Sometimes, you simply need to walk away and take a bit of time off from it entirely.</p>

    <h2>Working in a Creative Mindset</h2>
    <p>Ok, so you have some ideas and want to get down to the business of producing something. The challenge now is to minimize the distractions while still being able to use the tools of the trade. For example, to draw webtoons I’ll need my computer and its peripherals – but it’s these exact items that can make themselves a horrible distraction. If, while I’m trying to draw, I keep getting email or social media alerts, then this defeats the purpose. Likewise, if my 16-month-old is crying, the phone is ringing, or I know that I really ought to take the trash out, then these will disrupt the work as well. Of course, it’s not possible to ensure a totally distraction free environment, so take care of what’s within your control – take that trash out and attend to the 16-month old’s needs. That will help suppress some distractions, and put these things out of your mind, for at least a little while. Here are some steps you can take to create an environment more conducive to creativity:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Take care of any chores/tasks bugging you (settle the kid down to sleep, take out that trash, pay that bill)</li>
        <li>Suppress notifications on your devices (within reason – if you still need to be reached for work related concerns or emergencies, then make sure this is still possible)</li>
        <li>The temperature in the room or weather (if outside) are not distracting and annoying. In other words, you should be physically comfortable</li>
        <li>Your environment should be setup in such a way that enhances your creative process (see further down for details on this)</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>

    <h2>Breaking out of an Analytical Mindset</h2>
        <p>I find context-switching between an analytical mindset and a creative one to be very difficult. If my brain has been focusing on analytical work for a time, then it seems almost stuck in that mode. To switch into a creative mode, take a break, and if possible, do something enjoyable that has inspired you toward your creative endeavor in the past. For me, that might be reading some recently released webtoon episodes that I like, taking a quick walk, or oddly, playing a video game. I find that certain activities which cause your mind to go into auto-pilot mode are not helpful for getting into a creative mindset. For me, this includes things such as watching TV, reading the news, or scrolling through social media.</p>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Your Creative Environment</h2>
        <p>This is very intertwined with the previous topic of working in a creative mindset, but I wanted to call this out separately because I find that my work environment has a big impact on my mindset as I’m working. I’ve found there to be a divide between those times I need to focus on logical/analytical types of work vs. creative work. For my day job, I’m an engineer, and I always like to keep my desk perfectly clean when I’m working on the job. I find clutter to be highly distracting while I’m at work. I even keep my wires bundled up neatly out of the way so my feet touch nothing under the desk. Conversely, when I’m blogging or working on webtoons, I find the clutter to be helpful. I have reference drawings printed out and haphazardly hung all around the desk. I have figurines and trinkets scattered around and the wires on the desk are not so neat and bordering on a fire hazard. Ridiculously, I’ve gotten to the point where I have two completely separate desks – one for the day job and one for hobbies.</p>
        <p>Everybody is different and how their environments affect their thinking as they work will be different. I’ll try to tease out the generalities of the environment you’ll want to consider when working on creative or analytical work:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Clutter vs. clutter-free (If the pile of miscellaneous papers is bothering you, then clean it up!)</li>
        <li>Music (for both creative and analytical work, I must have music playing at all times. I tend to listen to more exciting music when doing creative work and calm, classical music while I’m doing the day job)</li>
        <li>Background noise (I find loud background noise disturbing in all circumstances, but particularly when doing analytical work. If the background noise is beyond your control, you might want to consider a white-noise machine)</li>
        <li>Lighting (For analytical work, I prefer a medium, warm, steady light. I have a lamp with a warm 25w bulb on my work desk. For creative work, I use brighter, daylight level lighting)</li>
        <li>Sitting vs. standing (my day job desk can move up and down to both sit and stand. I find that when I’m working on routine tasks, I like to stand. For meetings and for times when I need to intensely focus, I’ll usually sit. For creative work I pretty much sit all the time but that might be because using a drawing tablet is easier that way. However, this should be something you should consider for your overall environment)</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <p>Remember, your preferences for this list of considerations may be totally different from mine. They key is to give a little thought to each area on the list when preparing your environment.</p>
    <p>That’s about it for now! I would love to hear any ideas about how you get into a creative mindset or how you arrange your environment to accommodate creativity. There’s nothing more helpful to being creative than more creative ideas!</p>
