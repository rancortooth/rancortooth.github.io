<h1 id="doboneconductionheadphoneshelpyouhearspeechbetter">Do Bone Conduction Headphones Help You Hear Speech Better?</h1>
<p>If, like me, you have some difficulty understanding conversations a bit - not bad enough to warrant actual hearing aids - but bad enough that when you throw in a mix of Zoom-quality audio in meetings, plus your own crappy bluetooth headphones - you start to notice that some speech isn't quite so clear. Also, while it has been my pleasure to work with people from around the world, virtual globe-trotting brings with it a huge variety of accents, and if you're not used to somebody's speech, it can be difficult to get the hang of it at first (especially if one's hearing sucks). So, maybe, like me, you've gone out there trying to find some sort of not-a-hearing-aid-but-still-helps solution. I think I finally found something which I can at least say "makes a difference", although; it's no miracle cure.</p>
<h1 id="howdoboneconductionheadphoneswork">How Do Bone Conduction Headphones Work?</h1>
<p>Normal speakers or headphones transmit sound through the air which then vibrates the eardrum and in turn vibrates the bones of the middle ear which pass sound to the cochlea. Those signals get processed by your brain into what you perceive as sound. Bone conduction headphones vibrate bone, usually the cheekbone just in front of the ear, which then goes directly to the cochlea, bypassing the rest of the ear. Bone conduction headphones are held tight against the skin since they need to make contact in order to pass vibrations</p>
<h1 id="areboneconductionheadphonesexpensive">Are Bone Conduction Headphones expensive?</h1>
<p>Yes and no. To test them out, I originally bought an expensive pair for around $180 (SHOKZ OpenRun Pro). When I found that they seemed to make a difference I started wondering how well a cheaper pair would work. I purchased a cheaper pair for around $32 (OUFUNI) and was pleasantly surprised at how close they were to the more expensive ones. Yes, the SHOKZ felt higher quality, the charger snaps onto the headphones a bit better, and they have longer battery life - but the biggest difference is not voice, but music quality. These headphones are typically marketed as an athletic alternative to traditional headphones since they're water resistant and let you hear everything around you. However, their music fidelity isn't so great. The SHOKZ reproduced music better than the OUFUNI but neither could compare to even my mid-range Sony over-the-ear headphones for music sound quality. However, if human speech is mostly your concern then the difference there was almost unnoticeable.</p>
<h1 id="warnings">Warnings</h1>
<p>Bone conduction headphones can still cause hearing damage if played too loudly. As always, don't turn them up too high! Also, these headphones did give me a slight headache when I first started using them. It seemed to go away and hasn't come back. I've also read that they have the potential to cause dizziness in some people. I'm fairly sensitive when it comes to motion sickness but these didn't bother me in that way at all. One more small warning - they startled me when I used them for the first time! You can feel them vibrating and buzzing on the side of your head and it's a bit freaky at first.</p>
